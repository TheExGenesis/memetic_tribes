Francisco Carvalho, Jo√£o Andrade, Paulo Dias

Abstract:

In this course paper for the subject fo Complex Network Science, we follow up on the exploration of our Memetic Tribes dataset, undertaking three tasks. 1. We demonstrate the fidelity of a method we call pluri-ego-sampling, the one we used to obtain the dataset presented in our first project. 2. We attempt to explain the broken power law degree distribution exhibited by our dataset. 3. We attend to the original objective of the project, using community-finding methods to empirically detect the memetic tribes predicted and in Limberg, Barnes (Memetic Tribes in Culture War 2.0)[https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb] with encouraging results.
